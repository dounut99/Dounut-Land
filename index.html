    <p>The next big thing you should know when living here is that there is only one rule and that is you need to know to have a good life. The rule is if you are not having fun you go to jail. It's more of a bounce house carnival kind of jail. The only way out of jail is to have a lot of fun.

    <p><strong>How to get a donut!</strong></p><p>First, you get 4 cups of flours. You can get the cups from grinding flowers. Next, 2 large eggs from candy chickens, 1/4 cup sugar from the sugercane forest. After, 1 1/8 cups milk, 1/2 teaspoon salt from any rock candy caves. Following that 3 teaspoons yeast from the potato farms and 4 cups oil. Lastly, 1 1/4 cup butter. You can get that from the butterfly pollen. </p><p><strong>The Mixing Process</strong></p><p>Start with a bowl. Start with the milk, sugar, yeast and let it sit. Take butter and eggs in a bowl to mix. After 8 minutes of mixing add the two mixtures together. Put the dough in a oiled pan and into the fridge. After 8 hours leave it in the window house made for donuts.After it is made you can add all the sprinkles or DNA. You could buy baby donuts, but then you can't add the types of features.</p>
    <p>Well, that is all for Donut Land! Think about moving here. Fun fact you can be turned from human to donut if you want even. Think about it.</p>
